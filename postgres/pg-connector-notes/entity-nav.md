Start with search for 'employee', 'RelationalTable'
'NestedSchema Attribute' links us to all the columns
For example 'last name'

Can also navigate to RelationalDBSchemaType

From there 'AttributeForSchema' shows us the other tables

AssetSchemaType links us to a DeployedDatabaseSchema

Links to Database 'employees'

Links to the host server (postgreshostserver)  

Then to catalogs (at this point we need to do more work on the connector)
